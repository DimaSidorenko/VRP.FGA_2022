# Fluid Genetic Algorithm

In this repository there are two attempt to use FGA for solving Vehicle Routing Problems

I use genetic algorithm solution (https://github.com/Alexandr-TS/CVRP) to compare my FGA algorithm.

All work was done as part of the 3rd year course work and 4th final course work.

### You can find additional information in reports:
* [report 3rd year course work](https://github.com/DimaSidorenko/VPR.Fluid_Genetic_algorithm/blob/master/Final.pdf)
* [report 4th year course work](https://github.com/DimaSidorenko/VPR.Fluid_Genetic_algorithm/blob/master/Final.pdf)

, namely:
  * an analysis of the literature,
  * a description of the Fluid Genetic Algotirhm in general, 
  * a description of the designed FGA to solve Vehicle Routing Problem.
